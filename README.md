** Note **   
Since glove vectors are very large git hub couldn't be used to host it. I have currently hosted it using my google drive please download it using the following link https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Es5Ks0f4p9cpR1vbqODfj4VYsbp_A9d/view?usp=sharing and save a copy in data folder with the name "glove.6B.50d.txt"
